## What is Google AutoML?

Google AutoML is a suite of machine learning packages for developers with none to little knowledge of machine learning.
It allows the user to easily upload data to Google's cloud service, train the data, and make predictions with a simple 
click of a button at a very high speed. [@google-automl-sp20-516-240]

## AutoML Products

There are quite a few products in AutoML with a few different graphic user interfaces. They are split into a few categories:

* Sight
    * This allows for insights from images using either AutoML Vision or AutoML Video Intelligence
* Language
    * This allows for insights from text or audio data using AutoML Natural Language or AutoML Translation
* Structured Data
    * This allows for insights on your own custom structured data and datasets with AutoML Tables. A broader spectrum of
     capabilities based on the users needs.
    
## Who Uses AutoML?

Google AutoML is open to the public and businesses to use to deploy their Machine Learning models to help them gain 
insights for their projects or business. It is not a free service and you have to pay to use it but Google does offer 
some free credit to get you started. One example Google uses is Disney, where they quote

> "Cloud AutoML’s technology is helping us build vision models to annotate our products with Disney characters, 
>product categories, and colors. These annotations are being integrated into our search engine to enhance the impact 
>on Guest experience through more relevant search results, expedited discovery, and product recommendations on 
>shopDisney."

## How to Use AutoML

While I think it will be easy to list out a step by step algorithm to how to get started with AutoML, I think it's best 
to just share the videos Google Cloud Platform have already made.
